<h1>Research</h1>


<br>
We are working on various projects to improve the post-translation modification prediction task using deep learning methods, specifically natural language programming techniques.
<br><br>
Current Projects:
	
    1. Improving Protein Succinylation Sites Prediction Using Embeddings from Protein Language Model
    2. pLMSNOSite: an ensemble-based approach for prediction of protein S-nitrosylation sites integrating supervised word embedding and embeddings from protein language model
